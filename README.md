### Info about design choices in BLT_VS:

- Retina -> LGN -> V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V4 -> LOC -> Readout: kernel size and strides computed to match mean RF sizes for each ROI, assuming a 5deg image presentation for 224px images (additionally there's a provision for 128px in case you need a smaller network), channel size computed using #neurons comparison
- Avg. RF sizes (radii at 2.5deg): Retina: 0.18deg (Table 1, P-cells-surround https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042698994E0066T), LGN: 0.4 (Fig.5 https://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/1/338.full), V1: 0.75, V2: 0.8, V3: 1.37, V4: 1.85, LOC: 2.48 (Fig. 4 https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/31/38/13604.full.pdf)
- Avg. #neurons: Retina: 300k, LGN: 450k, V1: 98M, V2: 68.6M, V3: 39.2M, V4: 19.6M, LOC: 39.2M (see txt below - extremely crude approximations using chatgpt-o1-preview). Now there's 4 kinds of pyramidal cells in cortical columns it seems (see Fig in Box 1 https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12654) so we divide the numbers by half as we only care about the bottom-up and top-down pathways. So scaling is [1,1,326,229,131,65,131] - too large so I'll use relative scale - based roughly on square root - [1,1,18,15,11,8,11]
- For lateral connections, see Fig.6 of https://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/19/8633.long - visual field multiplication factor of around 2.5 found in V1, corresponding to a particular cortical distance. This implies the magnification factor reduces as we go to higher RF regions - I'll just use ks of 5 here (3 for 128px). Using depthwise separable convolutions to reduce #params (spread kernel and then mix channels)
- For topdown connections, we will use the same kernel and stride info as bottom-up connections and then scale output during forward pass implicitly with transposed convolutions
- For the prereadout layer, the BU output is num_classes+100 dims with conv layer kernel_size 5 (3 for 128px), then avgpool + slice classes -> losses, while the conv output (relued) goes back to LOC via transposed conv - this ensures we maintain spatial info for TD connections; we add features to maintain orientation, color, and other such info.
- Skip connections info - only V4 receives skip connections from V1, and only V1 receives skip connections from V4; although all layers from V1 to V4 are connected with each other (https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/1/1/1/408896?login=true), we only add these two long-range connection for simplicity here. They are also modeled as depthwise separable convolutions to save parameters. These connections ae additive to the bottom-up and top-down connections (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/13/9/3681.long).
- Connections to and from the pulvinar are not included - they potentially become important for attention and other such tasks, but for now, we'll keep it simple.
- The separate bottom-up and top-down streams, and multiplicative interactions (whoever is on distal dendrite is the multiplier), are inspired by cortical organisation, see Fig in Box 1 of https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12654. Lateral connections come and go in the same layers as BU and TD (https://www.jneurosci.org/content/3/5/1116.long) and they are additive as they latch onto proximal dendrites (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.903050303)

Below is a summary of the estimated average number of pyramidal neurons (or equivalent projection neurons) dedicated to processing the central 5 degrees of the visual field in various regions of the human visual system. Similar considerations are applied to the LGN and retina, focusing on the primary carriers of visual information (e.g., P and M cells). Relevant references are provided for each region for further reading.

### Note on Estimates:

#### Estimation Basis:
- The neuron counts are approximate and based on available data.
- Pyramidal neurons are estimated to constitute about 70% of the total neuronal population in cortical areas.
#### Cortical Magnification:
- The central 5 degrees of the visual field are overrepresented in the visual cortex to support high-acuity vision.
#### Variability:
- Individual differences and methodological approaches may affect estimates.
#### Methodology:
- Estimates combine data from histological studies, neuroimaging, and comparative anatomy.

### Explanation of Neuron Count Adjustments:

#### Pyramidal Neurons in Cortex:
- Only pyramidal neurons (principal excitatory neurons) are counted, excluding interneurons.
#### Relay Neurons in LGN:
- Focus is on relay neurons (P and M cells) that carry visual information to the cortex.
#### Ganglion Cells in Retina:
- Counting retinal ganglion cells (P and M cells), which are the output neurons of the retina transmitting visual signals to the brain.
